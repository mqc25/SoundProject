# SoundProject- 132A communication systems UCLA spring 2018 
 Here in this code as a part of our 132A extra credit project we tried to set up a 
 communication system between two laptops wirelessly:
 Text messages converted to **binary codes** are transmitted as **sound signlas** and from  one 
 one laptip and then recieved on the other one, using python and audacity software for 
 Recording signals. For purpose of sending sound signals the bulit in speakers of laptops
 are used (with sampling frequency of roughly **44100 Hz**)
